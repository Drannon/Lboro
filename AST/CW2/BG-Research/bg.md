#Background information on water security in the Test and Itchen Management Catchment Area

[DEFRA](https://environment.data.gov.uk/catchment-planning)

## River Basin Districts

There are 10 River Basin districts in England  
Within the South East district, there are 12 management catchments.  
The cities of Winchester and Southampton, and the towns of Romsey, Eastleigh, Andover, and a small section of south-
western Basingstoke are covered by the Test and Itchen management catchment.  
This Management Catchment are subdivided into three operational catchments: Itchen. Test Lower and Southampton
streams, and Test Upper and Middle.

[Test & Itchen](https://environment.data.gov.uk/catchment-planning/v/c3-plan/ManagementCatchment/3097)

Predominantly rural catchment, $1760km^{2}$.  
Two rivers - River Test, River Itchen. "...[T]wo of the finest chalk stream sin the world,...crystal clear waters
supporting a rich diversity of ... communities."   
Declared SSSI, Itchen declared Special Area of Conservation (SAoC).  
Internationally famous for trout and salmon fishing, supporting watercress and fish farming with high water quality
from groundwater.  
Dominated by Chalk in the north, providing groundwater for rivers.
This covers Romsey, Andover and Winchester.  
Southern part dominated by clay with different stream characteristics.
Southampton, Totton, Eastleigh.  
Supplying much of Hampshire's public water needs, and significant proportion of IoW's needs.  
Rivers have been modified in many ways:

- Structures
- Multiple channels
- Braided channels
- Mills
- Navigation
- Water Meadows

Which has lead to alterations in the flow.
Both rivers drain into the Solent.

### Itchen

[Itchen](https://environment.data.gov.uk/catchment-planning/OperationalCatchment/3237)

Itchen is fed by three major tributaries:

1. Candover Stream
2. River Alre
3. Cheriton Stream

Flows through villages, before Winchester, through water meadows, to N. Southampton.
Then joins Monks Brook just above tidal limit, then flows into Southampton Water.  
Also includes Itchen Navigation.

### Test Lower and Southampton Streams

[Test Lower and Southampton Streams](https://environment.data.gov.uk/catchment-planning/OperationalCatchment/3284)

Catchment includes sections of Test upstream of Romsey (confluence of Dun), down to Southampton Water @ Redbridge.  
Majority is clay.  
Downstream of Romsey, historical modifications share flows between several channels.  
Large public water supply abstraction @ Testwood, near where Test is joined by Blackwater.  
Test then flows through Lower Test Nature Reserve, joined by Luzborough Lane stream.  
Tanners Brook from North Baddesley discharges into Southampton Water separately.

### Test Upper and Middle

[Test Upper and Middle](https://environment.data.gov.uk/catchment-planning/OperationalCatchment/3485)

Catchment covers Test from source at Ashe, down to Mottisfont, Before confluence with Dun.
Broad floodplain down gentle gradient, with arable farmland and grazing on valley floor.
Gains water from underlying chalk and ephemeral tributaries.
SSSI, along with section of Dever, highly managed and modified.

## Water supplier

[ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?layers=19e680430d7f4e679002eecef04c31a8)

Most of the catchment area is covered by Southern Water.
The Western extent is covered partly by South West Water's Bournemouth area, around areas
such as Upper Canterton, Landford, Whiteparish, West Grimstead, Firsdown, the Wallops, partly by Wessex Water at
Lopcombe Corner and Upper Chute, and partly by Thames Water to the North around Combe.
The East is partially covered by South East Water around Nutley and Ropley

## Catchment Based Approach

*[CaBA](file:///home/matth/Downloads/Mendeley/pb13934-water-environment-catchment-based-approach.pdf)
[CaBA Website](https://catchmentbasedapproach.org)*

"The Catchment Based Approach (CaBA) is an inclusive, civil society-led initiative that works in partnership with
 Government, Local Authorities, Water Companies, businesses and more, to maximise the natural value of our environment."

Brought about after a government framework published in 2013.
"Locally focussed decision making and action should sit at the heart of...improvements to the water environment..."

Driven by the following definitions:

- Catchment: A geographic area defined naturally by surface water hydrology. ...Within this framework, we have adopted
the definiton of Management Catchments that the Environment Agency uses for managing availability of water..."

*DEFRA have a great flood management plan that has a good map of the Itchen and Test catchment. [CFMP](https://file:///home/matth/Downloads/Mendeley/Test_and_Itchen_Catchment_Flood_Management_Plan.pdf)*

<!-- Asked Victoria for the definiton -->
*No definition is forthcoming, so if it is around I can't find it*

This shall define the area of interest.

**By the looks of things, there is huge demand on two protected rivers to provide for the majority of Hampshire. The
high quality of water from the chalk in the north makes it desirable for farming and along with the throughput make it
of special interest to the water suppliers that draw from it. Southern Water is the key water supplier, even taking
water out of the catchment and removing it to the IoW, North of Andover and southwest to Brockenhurst.

There are a number of major draws from industry and settlement as well, with Andover, Winchester and particularly
Southampton drawing large amounts from the rivers for usage and Marchwood Power drawing from Southampton Water
downstream. This implies a reduction in throughput from the Test could cause issues with cooling the station?

With so many draws on the rivers and a reduced throughput from climate change, along with a cap on withdrawl to maintain
sufficient levels for the ecology in the area, water security is dependent on these rivers' ability to meet these
varying demands.

1. Understanding the key stakeholders in the catchment would be a first step towards generating recommendations, as
any recommendations would need to take into account the varying views and who actually controls what. Context diagram,
CATWOE, pig model?
2. Seeing the influence of the subsystems at play here would also be vital, so that sensitivity analysis can be performed
and recommendations can have the maximum positive effect for the minimum negative effect. Systemmigram, system
dynamics?
3. Understanding other sources of water for the catchment area would be intersting, to reduce the strain on the
Itchen and Test. Trying to thus quantify the large draws on two rivers would be beneficial. Lucy says to reword so that
it can be marked as a systems thinking exercise better.
4. Understand the impacts of reduced water security in the area, so that direction can be given to the recommendations.
CLD?
5. Predict the knock-on effects of interventions (both proposed and previous) in the area, to learn lessons from
previous work and to try and avoid disasters in implementations.
6. Water security is not just dependent on water quantity, but also quality. Readings from further down the Itchen
for example are quite poor and polluted, and there is a water treatment facility on the banks of the Itchen. Understanding
the impact of different system elements on water quality in the rivers would open a new avenue for recommendations.**

## Fri 14 Nov 14:20:32 GMT 2025 - Assumptions

*A cursory look at the assumptions I will need to bound the problem space.*

- Assume that the needs and impacts of the various independent water companies in the region are negligable.
- Assume that the needs of areas outside of the catchment area (e.g. IoW) remain static and can be modelled
monolithically.
- Assume that the local authority and regulators are respected, and that companies are not weighing risk of fines against
cost of compliance
- Further, assume that water companies are not lobbying to reduce fine amounts, but only to impact local policy.
