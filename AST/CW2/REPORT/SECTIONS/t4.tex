To produce the five recommendations, this paper considers six research questions whose answers will inform the recommendations.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What key stakeholders are in the Test and Itchen Management Catchment, and what are their worldviews?
    \item What subsystems are present in the system, and how do they interact with each other?
    \item What elements of the system are most sensitive to intervention?
    \item How effective are current initiatives at improving water security, and what can be learnt from them?
    \item What negative consequences are likely from interventions in sensitive areas?
    \item What are the greenhouse gas emittors in the system and in current initiatives, and how can they be mitigated?
\end{enumerate}
