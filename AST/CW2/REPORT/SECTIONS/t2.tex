The following assumptions are made in the analysis to bound the problem space:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item It is assumed that the needs and impacts of the various independant water companies that operate in the management catchment area, or otherwise abstract water from the Rivers Test and Itchen, are negligable compared to that of Southern Water and Portsmouth Water
    \item It is assumed that the needs of areas outside of the management catchment (e.g. the Isle of Wight) remain static and can be modelled as constants.
    \item It is assumed that stakeholders respect local authorities, regulators, and other organisations
    \item It is assumed that shareholders in public water companies would not unreasonably withold funding from them, and are not operating these companies illegally
    \item The debt held by public water companies is ignored
\end{enumerate}
